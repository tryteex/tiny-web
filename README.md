# tiny-web

`tiny-web` is a tiny async library (backend web server) that allows you to write a Laravel-style or Django-style backend in Rust language.

Short documentation for the library is [https://github.com/tryteex/tiny-web/blob/main/doc/Index.md](https://github.com/tryteex/tiny-web/blob/main/doc/Index.md).

This library works only with FastCGI, SCGI, UWSGI (modifier1=0) and HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

This library works with Postgresql or MS Sql Server databases.

## Stability Notice

Some components may change, however, the main interface for interacting with the application will remain finalized. The functionality will only be expanded.
