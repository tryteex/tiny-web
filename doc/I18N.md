## Internationalization
The library supports localization in multiple languages. All available languages are stored in the database in the `lang` table.

Language switching depends on the language selected by the user's session or system settings (default language).

After launching the program, the library recursively scans the directory `/app/module/class`, looking for files with the template `lang.{2 letter}`. Where `2 letter` is the language code according to ISO 639-1.  
These files serve as templates for the respective pairs __Module__-__Class__.
The file is divided into lines. Each line consists of two parts separated by a `=` sign.  
The first part is the key, which can be used in the controller, the second part is the translation itself.

For example, you have created a file `lang.en`
```toml
title=Title of main page
pay=Pay button
```
Then in the controllers, to get the corresponding key, you need to call the function `this.lang("key")`.
```rust
pub async fn index(this: &mut Action) -> Answer {

    let title = this.lang("title");
    let pay = this.lang("pay");

    this.set("title", title);
    this.set("pay", pay);
    
    this.render("index")
}
```
If no file is created for the installed language, the function `this.lang` will return the name of the key.
