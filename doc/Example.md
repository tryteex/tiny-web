## Example of simple site

Let's develop a simple website with the following functionality:
* The homepage displaying the latest 10 visitor reviews.
* An Ajax page for submitting reviews, which opens in a modal window.
* A button to update reviews without reloading the homepage or autoupdate each 20 seconds.
* Make it possible to change the last review if only 5 minutes have passed since its creation.
* Additionally create several information pages.
* In the header of the site, add the option to choose the interface language.

### Content:
* Database changes [Example_db.md](https://github.com/tryteex/tiny-web/blob/main/doc/Example_db.md).
* Configuration and execution [Example_run.md](https://github.com/tryteex/tiny-web/blob/main/doc/Example_run.md).

The finished project is in the directory [example](https://github.com/tryteex/tiny-web/tree/main/example).
